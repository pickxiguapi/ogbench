# LeWorldModel++

**LeWorldModel++ (LeWM++)** is a planning-interface framework for long-horizon image-goal control with frozen latent world models (e.g. LeWorldModel, DINO-WM). It addresses three coupled failures that arise when short model rollouts must serve distant goals: mismatched planning targets, uninformed action search, and restrictive terminal-state costs.

LeWM++ combines **LatentPathFlow** to generate reachable local targets, an **Action Chunk Prior** to initialize CEM from goal-directed offline behavior, and **Min-over-Horizon (MoH)** to score the closest predicted approach to the target. The controller executes one optimized action chunk and replans, preserving global intent through the final image goal while operating within a locally reliable prediction horizon.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pickxiguapi/leworldmodel_pp.git
cd leworldmodel_pp
uv sync --extra train --extra dev
```

## Training

Run all commands in this README from the repository root. Activate the
environment first:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

All launchers write checkpoints, latent caches, logs, and evaluation results
to `outputs/` by default. Change `EXPERIMENT_ROOT` at the top of a launcher if
you want a different location. Dataset and external-checkpoint paths remain
empty and must be filled in explicitly.

### LeWM Control Suite

1. Download the four official HDF5 datasets from the
[LeWM Hugging Face collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/quentinll/lewm):

- `quentinll/lewm-cube`: `cube_single_expert.tar.zst`;
- `quentinll/lewm-pusht`: `pusht_expert_train.h5.zst`;
- `quentinll/lewm-reacher`: `reacher.tar.zst`;
- `quentinll/lewm-tworooms`: `tworoom.tar.zst`.

2. Extract the archives and place the four HDF5 files in one directory using the
filenames below. Then convert each HDF5 file to its JPEG-backed Lance table:

```bash
LEWM_DATA_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/lewm-control-suite

for name in cube_single_expert pusht_expert_train reacher tworoom; do
  python scripts/convert_lewm_hdf5_to_lance.py \
    "$LEWM_DATA_ROOT/$name.h5" \
    "$LEWM_DATA_ROOT/$name.lance"
done
```

The prepared dataset directory should have this layout:

```text
lewm-control-suite/
├── cube_single_expert.h5
├── cube_single_expert.lance/
├── pusht_expert_train.h5
├── pusht_expert_train.lance/
├── reacher.h5
├── reacher.lance/
├── tworoom.h5
└── tworoom.lance/
```

After setting the paths at the top of each launcher, train all components in
dependency order:

```bash
# 3. Train the LeWM dynamics models.
bash experiments/train/train_lewm_4tasks.sh

# 4. Encode the offline datasets with the trained LeWM checkpoints.
bash experiments/precompute_lewm_latents_4tasks.sh

# 5. Train the final-goal-conditioned Action Chunk Priors.
bash experiments/train/train_action-prior-chunk_4tasks.sh

# 6. Train the H25 LatentPathFlow models.
bash experiments/train/train_subgoal_latent_path_flow_h25_4tasks.sh

# 7. Train the long-horizon LatentPathFlow models used for H50/H75/H100.
bash experiments/train/train_subgoal_latent_path_flow_longh_4tasks.sh
```

### Visual OGBench

The Action Chunk Prior uses an independent `impala_small` pixel encoder with
`p_aug=0.5`, matching the released checkpoints. It does not share LeWM features
and can be trained directly from the NPZ datasets without LeWM checkpoints or
latent caches. The precomputed latents below are used to train LatentPathFlow.

Expected filenames under `OGBENCH_DATA_ROOT` are the eight environment names ending in `.npz`, plus matching `-val.npz` files, such as `visual-cube-single-play-v0.npz` and `visual-cube-single-play-v0-val.npz`.

```bash
# 1. Train one frozen LeWM model for each Visual OGBench dataset.
bash experiments/train/train_lewm_visual_ogbench8.sh

# 2. Precompute checkpoint-bound latent datasets.
bash experiments/precompute_visual_ogbench8_latents.sh

# 3. Train the final-goal-conditioned Action Chunk Priors.
bash experiments/train/train_action-prior-chunk_visual_ogbench8.sh

# 4. Train the general-uniform-future LatentPathFlow models.
bash experiments/train/train_latent_path_flow_visual_ogbench8.sh
```

Visual OGBench training artifacts are written below `EXPERIMENT_ROOT/train/`.
Set the evaluation launchers' checkpoint-root variables to the corresponding
training directories when evaluating your own models.

## Pretrained artifacts

The exact checkpoints selected for the release evaluation are stored in
[`IffYuan/LeWorldModelplusplus`](https://huggingface.co/IffYuan/LeWorldModelplusplus).
Download them with:

```bash
uvx --from huggingface_hub hf download IffYuan/LeWorldModelplusplus \
  --include "*/checkpoints/**" --local-dir artifacts
```

The checkpoint repository uses this layout:

```text
artifacts/
├── lewm-control-suite/
│   └── checkpoints/
│       ├── lewm/{cube,pusht,reacher,tworoom}/
│       ├── action-prior/{cube,pusht,reacher,tworoom}/
│       └── latent-path-flow/{h25,longh}/{cube,pusht,reacher,tworoom}/
└── visual-ogbench/
    └── checkpoints/{lewm,action-prior,latent-path-flow}/<dataset-tag>/
```

Datasets are not included. Prepare them as described in Training above.
Keep the downloaded `config.json` and `flags.json` files beside their weights;
they are required to restore the models.

LeWM weights are named `weights_epoch_10.msgpack`, and LatentPathFlow weights
are named `checkpoint_200000.msgpack`. Action Prior weights are
`params_100000.pkl` for the Control Suite and `params_500000.pkl` for Visual OGBench.


## Evaluation

Activate the installed environment and run all commands from the repository root:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Edit the path assignments **inside each bash launcher** before running it.
The examples below assume checkpoints were downloaded to `artifacts/` in the
repository root. Set dataset paths to your local data directories and choose
`GPU_IDS` for your machine. Evaluation with pretrained checkpoints does not
require training or latent-cache precomputation.

### Planning effectiveness and long-horizon scaling (LeWM Control Suite)

In each `eval_lewmpp_h{25,50,75,100}_4tasks.sh`, set:

```bash
LEWM_DATA_ROOT="/absolute/path/to/lewm-control-suite"
EXPERIMENT_ROOT="outputs"
LEWM_CHECKPOINT_ROOT="artifacts/lewm-control-suite/checkpoints/lewm"
ACTION_PRIOR_CHECKPOINT_ROOT="artifacts/lewm-control-suite/checkpoints/action-prior"
```

Set `LATENT_PATH_FLOW_CHECKPOINT_ROOT` according to the launcher:

| Launcher | `LATENT_PATH_FLOW_CHECKPOINT_ROOT` |
| --- | --- |
| `eval_lewmpp_h25_4tasks.sh` | `artifacts/lewm-control-suite/checkpoints/latent-path-flow/h25` |
| `eval_lewmpp_h50_4tasks.sh`, `eval_lewmpp_h75_4tasks.sh`, `eval_lewmpp_h100_4tasks.sh` | `artifacts/lewm-control-suite/checkpoints/latent-path-flow/longh` |

These roots contain the four task directories; do not append a task name or
checkpoint filename. `LEWM_DATA_ROOT` must contain the four HDF5 files and their
converted Lance tables shown in Training above. In each
`eval_lewm_baseline_h{25,50,75,100}_4tasks.sh`, fill in only `LEWM_DATA_ROOT`,
`EXPERIMENT_ROOT`, and `LEWM_CHECKPOINT_ROOT`; the baseline requires only the HDF5 data.

The LeWM baseline follows the official CEM300x30, H5/RH5 protocol with an
action block of 5. LeWM++ uses CEM300x5 and H2/RH1 with the same action block.

Run all four evaluation horizons (50 episodes per task and three evaluation seeds):

```bash
for horizon in 25 50 75 100; do
  bash "experiments/eval/eval_lewmpp_h${horizon}_4tasks.sh"
  bash "experiments/eval/eval_lewm_baseline_h${horizon}_4tasks.sh"
done

python impls/aggregate_lewm_control_results.py \
  --results-root outputs/eval \
  --output outputs/eval/lewm_control_suite_summary.csv
```

Results are written to `outputs/eval/{lewmpp,lewm}_h<horizon>/<task>/seed<seed>/`.
If you change `EXPERIMENT_ROOT`, adjust the aggregation paths accordingly.

### More challenging tasks on Visual OGBench

In `eval_lewmpp_visual_ogbench8.sh`, set:

```bash
OGBENCH_DATA_ROOT="/absolute/path/to/visual-ogbench-data"
EXPERIMENT_ROOT="outputs"
LEWM_CHECKPOINT_ROOT="artifacts/visual-ogbench/checkpoints/lewm"
ACTION_PRIOR_CHECKPOINT_ROOT="artifacts/visual-ogbench/checkpoints/action-prior"
LATENT_PATH_FLOW_CHECKPOINT_ROOT="artifacts/visual-ogbench/checkpoints/latent-path-flow"
```

The checkpoint roots contain `cs_play`, `cd_play`, `ct_play`, `scene_play`,
`cs_noisy`, `cd_noisy`, `ct_noisy`, and `scene_noisy`. `OGBENCH_DATA_ROOT` must
contain the eight training NPZ files named after the environments, such as
`visual-cube-single-play-v0.npz`; these are used for action normalization.
In `eval_lewm_baseline_visual_ogbench8.sh`, set only `OGBENCH_DATA_ROOT`,
`EXPERIMENT_ROOT`, and `LEWM_CHECKPOINT_ROOT`.

Run all eight datasets with 50 episodes per official task and three evaluation
seeds. Both launchers write an aggregate summary automatically:

```bash
bash experiments/eval/eval_lewmpp_visual_ogbench8.sh
bash experiments/eval/eval_lewm_baseline_visual_ogbench8.sh
```

To regenerate the LeWM++ summary from completed results without rerunning the
environments (the full 50-episode, three-seed evaluation):

```bash
python impls/aggregate_visual_ogbench_results.py \
  --results-root outputs/eval/visual_ogbench_lewmpp \
  --output outputs/eval/visual_ogbench_lewmpp/summary.json
```
